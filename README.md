TODO:
- When there is a hundred cats, and they start spawning one each instead of two,

TODO:
- Bug: the first cat that spawns immediately runs off to the top left of the screen, and then spawn some more cat. It runs off the screen. It should immediately start running towards the center the screen/cruiser and spawn near the center.
